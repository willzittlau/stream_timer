## Features:
Focus Mode - Tap the screen to isolate the timer. When focus mode is on the app is set to always awake.

Themes - Simple Light & Dark theme. Tap the switch in the top right to switch between themes.

Fixed Text - Once 60s has passed, the seconds column becomes minutes, removing distractions from watching the seconds tick by during long activity. This setting looks great in timelapses where you want to record time in the video but not have ms/s shown.
